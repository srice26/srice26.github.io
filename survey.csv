17-Sep-22,Bateschella,12:30 AM,12:45 AM,3 - Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,"I heard the mechanical unicorn was fun and the poutine and pizza was great. I didn't really attend for long, just to see what was going on and grab pizza at the end of the night. The location and lighting was not the most inviting nor was the music. ",I would recommend a smaller venue or location. With such a large area it made the attendance seem sparce. A location that is less huge would make it seem more largely attended and would then make it more fun and actually promote more people to go. The lighting was very harsh and made it hard to walk into. The music also is an important factor. The artists who came mostly played original music which was nice but made it less widely enjoyable. Inviting a band to play that mostly does high energy covers of classic or well known songs would make people excited to attend.,1 - Did not meet my expectations,Music that nearly all people know and love really draws a crowd. I would stay away from bands playing mostly original music.,4 - Safe,Yes,,2 - Not fun,,3 - Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,We need more theme events to bring people together.

Just maybe have activities as a choice on the side while maintaining a theme. ",2023

Live music was good.,,4 - Exceeded my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,5 - Very fun,"The only thing I would consider changing would be concert times.

",,3 - Met my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,4 - Fun,I think this event would have been just a little bit better is there was dessert in addition to pizza.,3 - Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,"So far, I have found everyone to be kind and welcoming. Finding and maintaining friendships at the beginning of a social group is sort of difficult to me and has probably been the part of Bates that has given me the most strife up till now, but as we are settling into a rhythm of campus life I have found it is getting better. I was a little surprised how many parties people have been going to because that was not necessarily the impression I got about Bates while touring and talking to students, but I have found there are always people who dont want to go out and it hasn't been that big of a deal yet.","I really like the idea of FYCs, but for me, especially during orientation, it felt kind of limiting since we ate every meal and went to events together. I did not connect very closely to people in my group, but I've made friends with people from another FYC, so I think in general it would be nice if there were just more events that made small groups (even between class years) so that people (especially first years) could branch out faster. I also think events like campus wide scavenger hunts would be fun or big relay races. Something that gets the entire campus involved would be very cool. ",2026

17-Sep-22,BATESCHELLA,10:00 PM,12:00am (midnight),4 - Satisfied,"I thought that the event was fun, however, I think that it would be really awesome if after the campus bands played there could be artists that are more well known by the student population. For example, I know in Bates' history Waka Floka has performed, and I think that there would be a larger turn out of students if the performer was more mainstream. ",,3 - Met my expectations,,4 - Safe,Yes,,4 - Fun,"I knew of a lot of Bates students who had guests this weekend that were not allowed into the event because they are not Bates students. I understand that this policy exists for the safety of students and the Bates community, but I am hoping that in the future this policy may be amended. For example, Bates students could have the option to obtain one guest pass, and their guest would have to register with their own email address from their university, and then also bring their respective student ID to the event. This would let people who have a sibling or significant other who is visiting be included in the event. I understand that this rule is in place for the safety of the Bates community, but I am hoping that maybe this can be at least considered for future events.

Many campus employed adults made the event intimidating.,5 - Very safe,No,"Wish there was a guest policy where I could have registered my boyfriend who does not go to Bates. I understand not wanting random people to show up, but there should be a safe way to have guests attend. ",3 - Neither fun nor not fun,,3 - Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,"Really depends. Sometimes I feel like there is nothing going on on campus or that when there is something going on, campus life or Lewiston PD end it fast. I was excited for theme dances and other pre covid activities to come back but I was told that many of those traditions are dead and administration doesn├óÔé¼Ôäót want them to come back.

It wasn't that fun.","There should be more events listed. I think other booths for small things would be nice, like other physical activities and whatnot.

I am not much of a party person anyway, so I feel pretty satisfied with all the events that have happened so far.",,2026
24-Sep-22,BatesChella,10:00 PM,11:30 PM,2 - Dissatisfied,I expected there to be better music than what there was.

17-Sep-22,Bateschella,10:15 PM,12:30 AM,4 - Satisfied,I had a good time. Not the best time of my life but that probably couldn't be changed by anything infrastructural.,,2 - Met some of my expectations,I felt like it was a little all over the place. The pizza and stuff was outside of the actual venue sort of thing so you had to keep showing your wristband and sometimes standing in line again. It felt a little discombobulated.,4 - Safe,Yes,,4 - Fun,Thanks for the pizza and the free fries! That was super cool of you guys. College students always love food. Free food is even better.,3 - Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,"The party scene is kind of odd as compared to other schools. Lots of athletic exclusivity, and I know that's tough to change from an administrative point of view but it's still there. Especially for non-athlete first years, I think parties just sort of suck and are very freshman and hot and gross. Then, because it's not fun, kids try to drink more to make it more fun and end up going way too far.     The social events you guys put on are helpful. Always good to have something to show up to. Bateschella, club fair, etc. Also, the multifaith chaplaincy stuff has been great to meet people at in a genuine way. It's a very inclusive and peaceful environment.     The cops are annoying. ","School ping pong tourney. With an actual prize like 100 bucks of college store credit or a kims gift card or something else cool and worth winning for.   Honestly just intramurals in general. But like, one day events. A lot easier to show up and sustain effort at than week or weeks long ones.     Encourage use of the grills for club activities. Or just in general... Kalperis Hall cookout or something like that for people to sort of mingle. With games and stuff outside. Good food to encourage people to come. Friday afternoon or something.     I really wish the Den was open but I know that's not able to change right now. Looking forward to it next year.     Intramural dodgeball     Themes for field hockey games maybe? We could get hype for them.     Surf trip!!! does the outing club still do that?     Keep bringing cool artists to campus.     VCS? When will it start in earnest?     Cool speakers and stuff. Ted talk, Bates edition. Even a concert pianist or something might be pretty dope.     Theater department outsources playwriting to a group of potentially intoxicated college students (of age, of course). They get 48 hours to create a quality performance. The whole well hydrated school attends and supports.     Free pumpkins for Halloween. Then we all socialize with our friends to decorate them and stuff.     An espresso machine in Commons would improve social life tenfold in a plethora of different ways. More energy = more conversation = more friendships. People are happier when they can maximize their creativity into a quality product (think latte with espresso and milk instead of coffee and milk. Way closer to the real thing).     School cookoff. Like Gordon Ramsey chef competition. People enter and compete in various sections (dessert, salad, entree, best overall, etc) but they can only use stuff in commons. Could be online and over a week too.     Permanent outdoor ping pong tables and you check out the stuff from some easily accessible area. Purdue Uni has this and it's a hit.     Oktoberfest down Frye street. Or on Garcelon or the quad or whatever you think's best. This would actually be such a hit. If you guys just sort of helped out with the cop situation that'd be sick. And maybe got free giant pretzels for the first 700 students again. And live music! But rowdy stuff that's fun and dorky and weird and all. Please, if you disregard all of the above, take this one seriously. I would LOVE to dress up in lederhosen and fake a bad german accent. This would improve student mental health and social life by so much. ",2026

",2 - Dissatisfied,There├óÔé¼Ôäós never anything fun to do on the weekends. Halloween and bateschella have been the only major campus social events so far this year and bateschella wasn├óÔé¼Ôäót even fun because no one knew the music. That├óÔé¼Ôäós what VCS is for. On the weekends I want to go to places where I can dance with my friends to music I know and like. Also more free food! It├óÔé¼Ôäós so hard not having the den to get affordable food late at night and I feel like that problem is easily solvable.,Decades dances. Free food. Better music. Dances of any kind so long as there├óÔé¼Ôäós recognizable music or a fun theme to dress up for,2023

Like Snowball and Gala (whatever happened to decades dances?),4 - Satisfied,I think it would be better to have campus life events more frequently; I know this is expensive but it makes it so that are more social options on the weekends  I think there should be more events that have alcoholic beverages available for seniors :)  I think sometimes the alcohol policies can backfire because they result in people chugging their drink before they go in├óÔé¼ÔÇ£ sometimes this can lead to people getting sick at the venue,Where are the decades dances?  More events just for seniors? We had a lot of events taken away from us during our freshman/sophomore/junior years,2023

If you can't come up with a diverse playlist book professional djs to play music at such parties.  Also the rule is to not have alcoholic drinks which is GREAT but you let people who were too drunk to even walk by themselves into the building. Such people not only put themselves at risk but they cause alot of discomfort for sober or less drunk people because they step on people and display problematic behavior. Its almost the same as having them in there with alcohol.",#NAME?,1 - Did not meet my expectations,More organized and better planning on hour to regulate behavior of people inside the building,3 - Neither safe nor unsafe,No,Music was not diverse at all,2 - Not fun,,2 - Dissatisfied,its a very cliquie school and also racism is there.,,2025

I understand that some songs are inappropriate to play at a school-hosted event; however, investing in reaching out to students about what music they want to be heard at the dances can be useful.","I think the parties should start a bit earlier, maybe something like 9:00 pm.

I wish there had been a DJ instead of a band. I feel like that would be cheaper and also they would play more modern songs that students actually know? The band was kind of a bummer. I remember freshman year there was a DJ, at least I think. I think playing like more modern pop and hip hop songs would be a lot better in my opinion. The violinist was super cool but I felt bad for her. She is so talented but unfortunately nobody can really dance to violin music and people were making fun of her, which was a bummer.

I got very bored very quickly and, judging by the mass exodus that occured an hour and a half before the event ended, I wasn't the only one","I think if you either spent the money you put into getting multiple performers into getting a headliner, it would have been much better. If this isn't feasible, try to keep the performers semi basic (i.e just pay a couple quasi reputable edm djs to come up for a night). While as students we appreciate you trying to cover niches with special performances such as the violinists\, you would retain more people if you just kept it basic and catered to something everyone can enjoy.",2 - Met some of my expectations,"Having been at Bates for a few years, I've learned to take marketing and communications from campus life at face value. I limit my expectations to what is communicated because the events have never had anything thats pleasantly surprised me. In terms of meeting my expectations for this event, it met them in the sense that everything they said was going to be at the event was there. I went away saying ""Bates did everything that they said they were going to do"" not ""Wow bates did everything and went above and beyond"". However, In terms of my experience, I expected it to be far better because it retained my attention for 15 minutes.

Since they know the ages of everyone, they should be able to serve alcohol to of-age students at these events. This would create a better turnout and, more importantly, limit off or on campus parties with underage drinking and no supervision. If Bates actually wants to address partying at off campus houses it starts with providing safe and fun places for students so that they do not feel the need to go off campus. ",3 - Met my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,3 - Neither fun nor not fun,,2 - Dissatisfied,"Bates should not be dolling out harsh punishments to students for getting summons' at their off campus houses, because it does not go on their record and is handled outside of court and the police presinct. Furthermore, the police can escalate the summons to the houses' landlords, so there is no need to further incentivize students to avoid these. Additionally Bates needs to provide safe and fun spaces for students if they want to deescalate off-campus parties. ",,2024

2-Dec-23,Snowball,11:00 PM,12:30 AM,4 - Satisfied,"The DJ set was good but it seems like once you've heard a few of those sets, you've heard most of them. It's pretty similar to other campus events. With snowball being a unique event in the college's history, I would like to see something that suits the event more. I've heard it was an event that a girl approached a guy she was interested in for, and notwithstanding the progressive culture surrounding gender on campus, I think it would be great tradition to bring back. I don't think it would be detrimental to the inclusive culture on campus, and might actually be well received. I would also like to see a good combination of music that takes the mood in different places. Have some energetic parts, have some chill parts, have a few slow old school dance songs where people can take a break and have a little romance. The event is good but it doesn't really have space for that right now. ",,3 - Met my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,4 - Fun,"Students behave within the parameters of an event if it is specific. If the school hosts a basic (but still reasonably fun) club night, people will be concerned with drinking a lot and not deviate from their group dynamics. If the event was more specific and a little more old fashioned, I feel like students would embrace it and have a more special time. ",3 - Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,"CAT events feel similar. I know we have rules to follow but I would like to see more involvement in planning from student staffed committees, and these students encouraged to make events more unique and special. We are capable of having fun with our planning while observing social policies. When CAT does everything for us, it honestly makes us lazy and ungrateful; we don't appreciate it like we should. Students need more skin in these games. ",,2024
2-Dec-23,Snowball,11:15 PM,12:15 AM,1 - Highly dissatisfied,"It was poorly managed and it took 45 minutes just to get inside of the venue. People kept shoving a pushing others in line, throwing beer cans, drinking, smoking, and vaping. This caused me to have a panic attack in line. When I tried to leave the line to get somewhere to calm down, I  could not get out because people kept pushing me around in their drunken stupor. Eventually, I got out of line and took time to calm down before getting back in line 20 minutes later. When I made it to the event, at midnight, the music was so loud my ears started ringing and I got a headache. I ended up taking one photo to shoot with my friends and grabbing a slice of pizza before leaving because the environment was too overstimulated between the music, smoking/vaping, and the drunk people. Overall, not an enjoyable night and hardly worth the pizza. My only positive was that at least the DJ was playing good music. ","More thorough pat downs, better line management, Breathalyzer test before entering the event, and lowing the music volume",1 - Did not meet my expectations,Have better managed the crowds of people getting into the event.,1 - Very unsafe,No,Not have drunk and high people ogling you at every turn.

2-Dec-23,Snowball Dance,10:30 PM,11:30 PM,4 - Satisfied,I had a great time! The music was really good so I danced a lot with my friends. It's great in the grey cage because theres so many bathrooms and space to move around. The only way I think it could be improved would be more decor. The line was really long but it moved fast!,,3 - Met my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,4 - Fun,,4 - Satisfied,"I wish there were more events that aren't just in grey cage. Loved the fall fest on bardwell field. I'm super satisfied with my social life at Bates, but I'm also a senior with an off campus house so I feel like I have more opportunities to go out on the weekends. I think I would've appreciated more events when I was younger. ",,2024
2-Dec-23,Snowball,11:15 PM,12:30 AM,4 - Satisfied,I had a good time!,,3 - Met my expectations,,3 - Neither safe nor unsafe,Yes,,4 - Fun,the line entering was really not safe and scary to be in. a lot of people were being squished and it took us twenty minutes to get into the event,4 - Satisfied,it’s ok,,2026
2-Dec-23,Snowball,11:00 PM,12:30 AM,2 - Dissatisfied,"Took almost an hour to get in, the line was so long. Music was also too loud",Have a few more entrances or something to move the line faster.

2-Dec-23,Snowball,11:45 PM,12:00am (midnight),2 - Dissatisfied,The bass was turned up so aggressively high on the music that the reverberations I felt in my chest aggravated an ongoing medical issue and caused me physical pain. It looked like people were having fun! But I unfortunately had to depart.,"Well, hopefully the next time one of these events happen I am no longer having the aforementioned ongoing medical issue, but I would nonetheless advocate for the sound to be turned down just a little bit going forward. I am a regular concert-goer at country and alt-rock shows, including during other flare-ups of this medical issue, and have never had an experience where the sound was loud enough to aggravate the pain. I know that DJs like to have the bass up loud and I am not complaining about the actual music at the event, but I feel the need to be honest about my experience. ",3 - Met my expectations,,5 - Very safe,No,"I was not able to stay at the event for more than 10 minutes. My circumstances are unique, and I imagine that there are few, if any, other students with for whom bass reverberations cause pain, but several of my friends also expressed discomfort with the volume (including having Apple Watches alert them that the sound level could cause hearing loss). ",3 - Neither fun nor not fun,,4 - Satisfied,"I feel that I can always find things to do, whether they are campus life sponsored or not. ",,2024

Ran out of water again though which is no good   :(,,3 - Met my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,4 - Fun,Fruit was awesome. Would love to see more grapes and a variety of stuff. I would lose my mind over strawberries at an event like this but I understand that those might break the bank. Dried fruit things were cool too. And the cookies were gas.

Students were drunk and high and were pushing and shoving extremely in the line and I could barely breathe. I was railed into the railings and needed friends to help me get through the line that was insanely long. ",Work on the organization of letting students in promptly.

2-Dec-23,Snowball,10:45 PM,11:15 PM,2 - Dissatisfied,Felt like a copy-paste of the last dance. The line was also a complete mess while I was there. Luckily my friends and I arrived before it got REALLY long. Maybe add some more lanes?,"Doing things like switching the music or DJ up, switching the food/drink up, etc. would make the dances feel much more fresh. ",3 - Met my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,3 - Neither fun nor not fun,"I suggested changing things up between dances. I think that getting a theme and really going all into that would be great. I think that Harvest Dinner is the PERFECT event here, largely because everything coherently adds to the fall/thanksgiving theme. Obviously that is a much larger and more expensive event than a dance, but even just some wintery desserts would go a long way at a dance like this. ",4 - Satisfied,"I think everything run by the school tries its best to be inclusive without being bland, which is great. Obviously there's a big emphasis on alcohol across campus, because college, and thats just not my thing. But I still go to that stuff and love hanging out with my friends even if they're drinking. However, I do recognize how someone who is made uncomfortable with that would struggle here. ",,2025

The music and DJing was also good, and the staff were very friendly like usual.",,5 - Greatly exceeded my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,5 - Very fun,"Overall I think the event was good and a much better version of Bateschella, as I personally do not care for bringing guest artists and the other activities Bateschella offered, I mostly care about food, the DJ playing good music, and a good environment to socialize in with the staff being friendly and ensuring safety. While I did not attend the 21+ section, I think this is a good idea for seniors as they can drink alcohol if they so choose without any of the dangers of non-event drinking. Bateschella was also too loud and I could hear it from Adams freshmen year and it made my ears ring for an hour after, so the library quad is also a much better location for the event. The food was especially good as it was chicken bites and mozz sticks, which students like but does not require having to get an outside vender, even though I do love the poutine truck they had at past Bateschella events and Batescon. While I am not aware of the cost of this event versus Bateschella, I'd imagine it is cheaper as it does not involve contracts with guest artists. Therefore, if more events like this can be done as opposed to one Bateschella, I think that would be best for the social night life options at Bates College.",4 - Satisfied,"I feel like the social life on Bates is what you make it out to be. While it is not perfect, there are different ways for everyone to socialize and I am able to expand my circle while maintaining the close friendships I have.","I think more chill events like this with a variety of free food offerings like Curb Cats would be great.

The music was ok, the band seemed to not know some of the words. The photo booth lacked props that were usually there. Overall, the event seemed more empty and as if it had a noticeably lower budget than previous dances.","Much better food. An event that is ""formal"" shouldn't have dining hall food! I would also think a DJ instead of a band is better. Or, at the very least, a way to take requests for music before the event so the music could appeal to everyone there. ",2 - Met some of my expectations,"There wasn't much marketing. I wish that Bates did a better job at announcing the events with enough time beforehand. It makes trying to go to events (in buying clothes, making plans, and even travel arrangements) much harder. I'm not really sure why the events aren't announced at least a month in advance because I know that Bates has had the events planned for a significant amount of time. Keeping students out of the loop just creates more burden for them and makes it harder for people to attend the event. ",4 - Safe,Yes,,3 - Neither fun nor not fun,"Importantly, the food was mislabeled. The ""Sweet & Sour Chicken Meatballs"" was labeled as vegan. Not only is this dangerous, if someone has not eaten meat in awhile and was misled and had stomach problems after, it can also cause moral issues, anxiety, and religious issues. I, as a vegetarian for a decade, faced a lot of anxiety and distrust around the food and did not feel comfortable eating anymore of the food at the event. The inedible food (with all the food I did try being disgusting) and the mislabeling show the lack of planning that went into this event. Disappointing.

If you want and search for a good time, you will likely have one, but it's also not ideal that there isn't always an option waiting for you, so you have to go looking for one in the first place. ","I know that budgeting is an issue here, but I think students would greatly appreciate having some sort of concert on campus, or some other event/festival situation that isn't a full-on dance, but also isn't as niche as a silent disco.

I wouldn't even say I'm a particularly unapproachable person, I'm just unconfident. I know plenty of people at Bates, but I wouldn't say I have a lot of friends. It also feels like people on sports teams are uncompromising in their allegiance to their team and it's very hard to hang out with them or get them to do anything outside of their sport. Obviously that is the nature of sports teams (they spend a lot of time together). the TLDR is Freshman NARPS who aren't particularly outgoing or athletic struggle to make friends at this school.

The music wasn't my favorite, but overall the event was good.",,3 - Met my expectations,,4 - Safe,Yes,,4 - Fun,"It was grossly inappropriate to hold the Halloween dance on the anniversary of the Oct 25, 2023 Lewiston shooting. I am concerned that this was considered an acceptable course of action. Especially when you consider that this weekend was not the weekend closest to Halloween, picking the day of the 25th is absurd. Given that in the past, Halloween has been between two weekends, I understand why in the past it has been held the weekend before. However, that was not the case this year, as Halloween is on Saturday the 31st. I think it would have made the most sense to put it that day, but even if there were issues with the day itself that I don't know of, the days before also make sense. It was incredibly insensitive to hold the dance on the day of the shooting anniversary. I know many people who could not come because they were mourning instead, and several people who decided not to come because they didn't feel like celebrating on the same day as the anniversary of such a tragic event, and many people who felt really uncomfortable about the timing, even thought they ended up deciding to come anyway.",4 - Satisfied,"There's not a lot of casual hangouts (think pub nights) that most people go to on a regular basis, so it limits the kind of casual social activity that happens on campus (most of it is friend-group based) which is tricky. Otherwise, things are good.",I'd love for there to be regular pub nights (that don't necessarily involve drinking) but are centered around meeting in a chill space and hanging out near people / community.,2027

",,5 - Greatly exceeded my expectations,,5 - Very safe,Yes,,5 - Very fun,"Please please please organize more events like these throughout the year. We love them far more than the house parties, which can get chaotic and dangerous at times, and they are genuinely so much more fun. The staff is also there to make sure people do not get hurt and everything stays orderly but fun. Thank you. ",4 - Satisfied,"I think there is plenty of activities to engage in here at Bates. It could be better, there could be more theatrical events, music events, casual social activities (for eg. Kalperis vs Chu Hall Table Tennis tournament, which took place a few weeks ago). ","I think, however it may be implemented, there should be more hall and house activities organized by the JA's. It's very important to develop a friendly environment and close-knit community in your respective dorm buildings (and with other dorm buildings in joint events), as it would foster a warmer atmosphere in which we can all be happy we live in. This can happen in the form of late night discussions around some snacks, movie nights, board game nights, or going out together somewhere.   Additionally, please I beg you organize more parties like the Halloween dance. They are much appreciated and so much better/safer than the student organized house parties.   Thank you!",2029
